1. Launch the application with `python Application.py` and open the **Visual selector** tab.
2. Enter the full product page URL and click **Ouvrir** to load the preview.
3. Close or ignore any pop-ups (cookies, sign-up...) so you can see the element.
4. Move the mouse over the page: the hovered element is highlighted in red.
5. Click the desired element. The generated CSS selector appears in the field.
6. Use **Copier** to copy the selector to the clipboard or **Sauvegarder** to store it in `selectors.json` at the project root.
7. Repeat for each site or information type to scrape. Saved selectors can be reused by the scraping scripts.
8. Tip: always test your selectors on several products to avoid errors when running automated scraping.
