# Audit Report

## Summary
- Verified repository structure: includes CLI, GUI, scraping, optimization and Flask API modules with tests.
- Detected failing tests due to missing PySide6 shared libraries when importing `scraper_woocommerce`.
- Patched `scraper_woocommerce.py` to load `QImage` conditionally and provide a minimal stub when PySide6 is absent.
- All tests now pass using `PYTHONPATH=$PWD pytest -q`.

## Recommendations
- Package layout is flat; `pip install -e .` fails. Define explicit packages in `pyproject.toml` if distribution is required.
- Consider adding `pytest-asyncio` to test dependencies to run async tests without warnings.
- Document the need to set `PYTHONPATH` or install as package when running tests.
